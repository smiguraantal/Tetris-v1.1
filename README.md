# Tetris v1.1

The application is a classic Tetris game that I developed in 2003 using the Java Swing framework and JDK 1.5. To ensure compatibility with modern Java Runtime Environments, I made a few minor modifications.

## The purpose of the game

Move the shapes into the correct position. If you fill an entire row with shapes, it will disappear. Try to fill multiple rows at once to earn more points:

- One row = 1,000 points
- Two rows = 3,000 points
- Three rows = 7,000 points
- Four rows = 15,000 points.

If you run out of space, the game ends. The speed increases after every 50,000 points. If the game feels too easy, you can stop and adjust the mode, speed, or level. The direction of rotation can also be changed.

## Control keys

- F2: New game / Clear game
- F3: Pause / Continue
- Space: Change direction of rotation / Rotate
- Left arrow: Change level / Move left
- Right arrow: Change speed / Move right
- Down arrow: Change mode / Move down
